safe - simple symmetric-key password encrypter
==============================================
safe is a simple symmetric-key encrypter. Combined with usual Unix
utilities, it can be used as a suckless, flexible password manager.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (safe is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install safe (if
necessary as root):

    make clean tests install


Usage
-----
Please refer to the manual page for more information.


Cryptographic security
----------------------
safe uses its own implementation of a custom system involving Chacha20
at its core, Murmur3 and host system pseudorandom number generation.
